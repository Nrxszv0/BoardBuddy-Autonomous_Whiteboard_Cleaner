# BoardBuddy-Autonomous_Whiteboard_Cleaner
An autonomous robot designed to help with custodial duties and save time.

The main robot consists of an arduino with continuous servo motors, a bluetooth module, an intertial measurement unit, and an LCD. It used neodymium magnets to stick to the whitebaord and a shop towel to erase. 
A Raspberry Pi was going to be implemented to control a camera and sent bluetooth commands to the robot to traverse to different sections of the robot.
Unfortunately, the Rasberry Pi code was wiped when the Pi came in too close proximity of the magnets. All of the code for detecting the april tags and contours on the whiteboard was lost. There are plans to revisit the program and remake the lost code to continue developing the robot.
A demo was also made to show how the robot could be made without the raspberry pi and only use sensors, bump switches and ultrasonic distance sensors to erase the whiteboard.
